# Tyrell Fetch Submission - Forecasting Receipt Amounts for 2022

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to forecasting the approximate amount of receipt transactions for the upcoming months in 2022. It employs a custom-built model that uniquely combines various data components to enhance forecasting accuracy. The core of the model's approach lies in its additive combination of trend analysis, seasonal variations, and residual data to construct a comprehensive forecast.

## Key Features

- **Integrated Forecasting Model**: The model additively combines:
    - **Trend Analysis**: Evaluating long-term trends in receipt amounts to understand overarching market dynamics.
    - **Seasonal Analysis**: Identifying and measuring seasonal patterns within the data, crucial for capturing regular, periodic fluctuations.
    - **Residual Analysis**: Analyzing the residuals (differences between observed values and model predictions) to refine and adjust the forecast.

## Objective

The primary aim is to provide a reliable and nuanced forecast of receipt amounts, aiding in better decision-making processes for inventory management, financial planning, and business strategy. The modelâ€™s additive approach to incorporating trend, seasonal, and residual elements is designed to offer a more accurate and holistic view of future receipt trends.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Key libraries for efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application framework to demonstrate model results.
- **TensorFlow**: For advanced machine learning model development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you in getting a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install:

- **Git**
- **Docker**

#### Installing Git

Download and install Git from [Git's website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

#### Installing Docker

Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Installing and Running the Application

Follow these steps to set up your development environment.

#### Cloning the Repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tyrellto/tyrell_fetch_submission.git
cd tyrell_fetch_submission
```

#### Building the Docker Image

Build the Docker image with:

```bash
docker build -t mystreamlitapp .
```

This command builds a Docker image named `mystreamlitapp` from the Dockerfile in your project directory.

#### Running the Streamlit App

Run the app using:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 mystreamlitapp
```

This command starts a container from the `mystreamlitapp` image and maps port 8501 from the container to port 8501 on your host machine.

### Accessing the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`. You should now see the Streamlit app running.


## Model Training and Visualization

The core of the model training and its visual inspection are conducted through the `train_model.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. This notebook contains detailed steps and visualizations essential for understanding and replicating the model.

### Key Features

- **train_model.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook used for:
    - Training the forecasting model.
    - Visual inspection of the model's performance.
    - Detailed documentation of the methodology and analysis.

### Prerequisites for Replication

To replicate and further develop the model, the following are required:

- **Jupyter Notebook Environment**: An IDE or platform that can run Jupyter notebooks is essential. Options include:
    - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): A free, cloud-based service that supports Jupyter notebooks.
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): With its Jupyter extension, it allows for running and visualizing notebooks.
    - [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/): A web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks.
- **Python Libraries**: Ensure that all Python libraries used in `train_model.ipynb` are installed. Typically, these can be found in a `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the Notebook

1. Open `train_model.ipynb` in your preferred Jupyter notebook environment.
2. Execute the cells in sequence to train the model and view the visualizations.
